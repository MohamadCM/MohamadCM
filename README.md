## About Me

I am a computer engineer specialized in the computer architecture, embedded systems, and IoT development arena. However, I have been working in various industries across the computer science universe for the last three years. I'm also a hands-on engineer in all stages of the software development cycle, from planning and design to testing and deployment.
I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), where I'm also a part-time research assistant working on distributed embedded automotive systems and a teaching assistant.

I'm interested in solving problems, creating new opportunities, leading teams, teaching, and doing hands-on R&D projects. 
My last job was being a Technical Leader and a Scrum Master at Hadish Sabz Parseh Co., one of the top consumer electronics companies in the Middle East.

If you want to talk about engineering, leadership, teaching or anything else, drop me a line. I am currently unavailable for employment, but I am eager to hear from GitHub users. You can also find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/MohamadCM/ "Mohamad ChamanMotlagh at Linkedin").
